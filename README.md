## Key Features

- **Sequential API Key Rotation** — Pool up to 20+ free-tier Gemini keys and rotate them automatically, so you effectively never hit a rate limit.
- **Dual-Mode Operation** — Toggle between **Normal** (single active key) and **Unlimited** (full round-robin rotation) with an animated glowing switch.
- **Custom Model Management** — Easily add, configure, and manage custom Gemini AI models directly from the Settings interface.
- **Auto-Focus Chat Input** — Continuous focus management ensuring the prompt textarea automatically regains focus after the AI responds.
- **Native Keyboard Shortcuts** — Full cross-platform keyboard shortcut support (Windows & macOS) for quick navigation, sending messages, and controlling sessions.
- **HTML Artifact Generation & Auto-Download** — Automatically generate HTML files/artifacts with instant client-side download triggers.
- **Google AI Studio Quick Link** — Dedicated `API` dock button to open Google AI Studio (`https://aistudio.google.com/`) directly in your browser for fast API key retrieval.
- **Secure OS Keyring Integration** — API keys are stored securely using your operating system's native credential manager.
- **Seamless Dark & Light Themes** — Modern color-scheme aware theme engine with full dark mode support, glassmorphism panels, and customized native dropdown menus.
- **Audio Upload & Speech Transcription** — Upload audio files (MP3, WAV, M4A, OGG, AAC, WEBP audio) for automated AI audio transcription, translation, and analysis.
- **Multi-Format Upload & Docx Processing** — Drag-and-drop support for PDFs, DOCX documents, audio files, images (PNG, JPEG, WEBP), plain text, and CSV files.
- **Custom AI Skills & Agents** — Create and manage distinct personas with custom system prompts for specialized tasks (e.g., Code Review, Writing Assistance).
- **Advanced Model Configuration** — Fine-tune AI behavior with adjustable thinking levels (Low, Medium, High), output lengths, safety settings, and grounding tools.
- **Detailed Usage Statistics** — Track token consumption with comprehensive metrics broken down by day, model, and individual API key.
- **Session Management** — Organize workflows into multiple concurrent chat sessions with auto-generated titles and local persistence.
- **Local-First Privacy** — API keys and chat history live exclusively on your device; nothing is sent to third-party tracking servers.

## How It Works — Routing & Rotation

KeyLooper uses a rotation engine to distribute your API requests based on your selected mode:

### 1. Normal Mode (Single Active Key)
In Normal mode, the app uses the **first healthy key** in your list. 
- If a rate limit is hit, that key goes on a 60-second cooldown, and the app temporarily falls back to the next key.
- If you pause for 2-3 minutes (allowing the cooldown to expire), the app immediately routes back through the primary key on your next request.

### 2. Unlimited Mode (Round-Robin)
In Unlimited mode, the app uses strict **sequential round-robin** rotation to balance the load equally across all your accounts.
- The app maintains a global index pointer that remembers exactly which key it used last. 
- Even if you pause for several minutes or hours, the app remembers where it left off and routes your next message through the *next* key in the sequence, not starting over from the top.

```text
User sends message M1 → Key A (index 0) → index becomes 1
User sends message M2 → Key B (index 1) → index becomes 2
User sends message M3 → Key C (index 2) → index becomes 3
User sends message M4 → Key A (index 0) → wraps back to 0
```

**Graceful Failure Handling (Both Modes):**
1. Key returns `429 Rate Limited` → marked as rate-limited (60s cooldown) → skipped automatically
2. Key returns `400/401/403 Invalid` → marked as invalid → skipped permanently until manually fixed
3. Retries up to **3 times** across different keys before surfacing an error dialog
